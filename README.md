# bearbot 🐻

### 🐻🐾 who is bearbot?
A friendly lil Discord bot that you can interact with that promotes positivity and good vibes, and is there for you when you are down.

### 🐻🐾 what can they do?
Bearbot has currently learned how to do the following things to support their friends:

- **/bearnice**: replies to the user with an affirmation from [Annthurium's Affirmations API](https://github.com/annthurium/affirmations).

- **/bearhug**: replies to the user with a gif of a hug from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

- **/owo**: a ping command where bearbot will reply with an uwu. 

### 🐻🐾 anything else?

Slash commands can also be registered as seen below by running index.js -- this is super nice because the user can know exactly what bearbot can do for them within the app and without having to reference external documents.

### 🐻🐾 next steps?

- Figuring out how to host this on my own home lab - I will probably look into hosting a node image in a Docker/LXC container. This will be a whole new adventure. 👀
- Figuring out how to use multiple guild IDs for multiple servers.
- What more features to add? Not sure yet.
